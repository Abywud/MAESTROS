# Description

This repository contains a coding assignment for SDF-PT10 Code Challenge conducted on March 20, 2025. The assignment focuses on fundamental JavaScript concepts, including:

## Variable Manipulation 
 Declaring, initializing, and modifying variables.

## Conditional Statements 
Using if, else if, and else to implement decision-making logic.

## Functions and Scope 
Defining functions, using parameters/arguments, and understanding local vs. global scope.


`The main JavaScript file, assignment.js, contains solutions implementing these concepts.`

## Setting Up the Repository Locally

Follow these steps to clone and set up the repository on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository

```git clone  http://github.com/xyz ```



2. Navigate to the Project Directory

cd <repository-folder>

Replace <repository-folder> with the name of the cloned repository.


3. Ensure You Have Node.js Installed
Check if Node.js is installed:

node -v

If not installed, download and install it from Node.js official website.



Running assignment.js

To execute the JavaScript file, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository folder:

cd <repository-folder>


2. Run the JavaScript file using Node.js:

node assignment.js



Expected Outputs

The script will output results based on variable manipulations, condition checks, and function calls.

If user input is required, follow on-screen prompts (if applicable).


Ensure all dependencies (if any) are installed before running the script. If the script relies on external packages, install them using:

npm install

For any issues, check error messages or ensure the correct Node.js version is installed.
